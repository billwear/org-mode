2. Task storage
3. MSP multi-scale planning framework
4. Autopilot systems: the more you can automate, the less mental

2. Detail the Work on the Public Show and Tell:
"I've been dedicated to preparing a public show and tell. This involves demonstrating the advanced time management techniques I've employed, which have significantly boosted my productivity. The preparation required deep, uninterrupted work sessions, ensuring that the content is both insightful and practically applicable."

5. Conclude with the Value and Future Direction:
"This project, I believe, adds substantial value to our team's understanding of effective time management. Moving forward, I'll integrate the insights from this show and tell into our regular work processes, enhancing both individual and team productivity."
