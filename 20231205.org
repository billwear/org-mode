it's a regular tuesday, so far.  not too bad: woke up on my own before
the alarm went off, went ahead and took a shower and organized my
shower stuff so i don't have to remember what to do and when; it's
good to make it a habit to get up, feed baby, head to the bathroom, do
the hygiene thing, come back and dress, fix the couch, & do vitals &
meds.

** TODO pick a shorter how-to and apply today's conversations to it
